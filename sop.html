Statement of Purpose
I am actively looking for pursuing Masters/PhD in Computer Science, driven by a profound interest in leveraging AI to find solutions for the mysteries in healthcare related to the diagnosis of some of the diseases under Cyanotic congenital heart diseases and Rheumatic heart disease as well as improve patient outcomes. With a zeal to make a strong foundation in AI and data analytics, combined with research experience in medical applications, I am eager to contribute to advancements in personalized medicine, early disease diagnosis, and efficient healthcare delivery.
Academic Background
My academic journey began with a B.Tech in IT Engineering from Kurukshetra University, where I graduated as a gold medalist of my batch. This achievement reflects my dedication to academic excellence and passion for solving complex problems. My pursuit of knowledge led me to enroll in a Graduate Certificate program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Lambton College, Toronto where I am deepening my understanding of cutting-edge AI techniques and their applications.
Additionally, I have completed the AI in Medicine Specialization offered by DeepLearning.ai and Stanford University, which provided a solid grasp of machine learning algorithms tailored to medical data. This specialization exposed me to diverse topics, including disease prediction, medical imaging, and clinical decision-making, fueling my aspiration to pursue further research in this domain.
Research Experience
My research endeavors include publishing three peer-reviewed papers:
1.	"Convergence of AR, VR, IoT with Artificial Intelligence to Train Surgeons for Medical Surgeries” (Taylor & Francis, USA, 2022)
2.	"Early Diagnosis of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease Using Deep Learning" (Apple Academic Press, UAE, 2023).
3.	“Depression; Diagnosis and beyond using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning” (STEM Fellowship, Inter University Big Data Challenge  Conference, 2024).
4.	“Brain Tumor Segmentation using Deep Neural Network Analysis”, (IJIRST, 2024)
5.	“Application of Explainable AI for the Diagnosis of Coronary Heart Disease”, (IJIRST, 2024)

These works reflect my ability to integrate AI methodologies with healthcare challenges, such as automating administrative tasks and enhancing diagnostic accuracy. My exploration of deep learning frameworks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing (NLP), laid the groundwork for addressing real-world medical problems.
Professional Experience
Professionally, I have honed my skills as a Data Analyst at Fetchy, Toronto, and PyTech IT Solutions, Kathmandu. These roles involved managing and analyzing large datasets, building predictive models, and developing data visualization tools to drive actionable insights. At MindRiser’s Consortium, I worked as a Data Scientist, focusing on medical data analysis, further aligning my expertise with healthcare research.
Research Goals
My primary research interests lie in developing AI models for early disease detection and predictive analytics. I am particularly drawn to exploring deep learning architectures for analyzing high-dimensional medical imaging data, such as MRI and CT scans, to identify biomarkers and enhance diagnostic precision. I am also interested in creating AI-driven frameworks for personalized treatment planning, leveraging multi-modal data integration from genetic, clinical, and environmental datasets.
Long-term Vision
Upon completing my PhD, I aspire to establish a career as a researcher and educator in AI in medicine, contributing to both academia and industry. I envision leading initiatives that bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI innovations and their practical applications in clinical settings, ultimately enhancing healthcare accessibility and quality.
With a steadfast commitment to advancing AI in medicine and a proven track record of academic and professional accomplishments, I am confident in my ability to contribute meaningfully to the research community. I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with faculty and peers in addressing some of the most pressing challenges in modern healthcare through the transformative power of AI.
Thank you for considering my application.
Sincerely,
Rishabh Jha
