                    <a href="https://github.com/rishabhjha1/Explainable-AI-2">Application of Explainable AI for Cardio Vascular Disease Research</a>
                    <p>Explainable AI (XAI) is transforming cardiovascular disease research by enhancing the interpretability of complex machine learning models used in diagnosis and prognosis. XAI provides transparency by elucidating how models identify risk factors, predict outcomes, and recommend treatments. This fosters trust among clinicians and patients while enabling actionable insights. In cardiovascular research, XAI bridges the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical, human-centric medical decision-making, ensuring equitable and ethical healthcare advancements.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/rishabhjha1/Medical-Imaging-Analysis-Using-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation">Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Using UNet</a>
                    <p>
                        This analysis focuses on leveraging the UNet architecture for precise segmentation of brain tumors, specifically High-Grade Gliomas (HGG), using the BraTS dataset. UNet, a deep learning model designed for biomedical image segmentation, enables efficient identification of tumor boundaries, enhancing diagnostic accuracy. The study involves preprocessing MRI images, training the model on annotated data, and evaluating its performance using metrics like Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of UNet in capturing complex tumor structures, providing a reliable tool for clinical applications and further research in automated tumor analysis.</p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/rishabhjha1/Doc-Assistant">Doc Assistant App</a>
                    <p>The Doc-Assist system that is proposed through this project is an agent that is trained on thousands of medical conditions and their adjacent medicinal prescriptions. Through this system, medical professionals can have an immediate symptomatic analysis of the patient, and thus a brief treatment plan can be generated, which they later can approve. This can not only enhance their performance but also increase the number of daily patients that they can see. This system is built upon the principles of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and later a BERT based LLM model is used to increase the efficiency of the same. </p>

                    <a href="https://github.com/rishabhjha1/Dropout-Prediction">Dropout Prediction</a>
                    <p>The Dropout Prediction repository focuses on predicting student dropout risks using machine learning techniques. It aims to analyze academic and behavioral data to identify students at risk of leaving educational programs prematurely. The project employs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification models to build an accurate predictive system. By leveraging insights from the data, this tool can help educational institutions implement early interventions to improve retention rates. The repository highlights practical applications of machine learning in education, showcasing data-driven approaches to addressing a critical issue in academic environments.</p>
